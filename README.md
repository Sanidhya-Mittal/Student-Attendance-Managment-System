# Student_Attendance_Management_System serves as a backbone structure to give an idea of how an attendance portal may function. 

The code for the system can be downloaded from my Github page.
I have used XAMPP for database.
If someone needs to use the software as is , they may download the code and make a folder in htdocs folder in XAMPP application. They just need to change database username and password on their system and make the same changes in database.php file in database folder of this project.
